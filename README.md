## 📖 What is HTML?

**Imagine you want to create a website. HTML is the language that tells the browser what content to show and how to organize it. It defines things like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms, so everything on the page has a proper place. Without HTML, a website would just be a blank page — HTML gives it structure and meaning, making it possible for users to see and interact with the content.HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)** is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages.

## 🧱 Basic HTML Structure

Every HTML page has this **core structure**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Fun HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page 🎉</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
    <img src="fun-image.jpg" alt="Fun image" width="200">
</body>
</html>

```

## Explanation of Syntax

<!DOCTYPE html> → Declares this is an HTML5 page

<html> → Root element of the page

<head> → Meta information about the page

<meta charset="UTF-8"> → Ensures text displays correctly

<title> → Sets the browser tab title

<body> → Visible content of the page

<h1> → Main heading

<p> → Paragraph text

<a> → Link to another webpage

<img> → Displays an image
