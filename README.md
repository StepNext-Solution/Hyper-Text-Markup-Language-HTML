## 📖 What is HTML?

**Imagine you want to create a website. HTML is the language that tells the browser what content to show and how to organize it. It defines things like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms, so everything on the page has a proper place. Without HTML, a website would just be a blank page — HTML gives it structure and meaning, making it possible for users to see and interact with the content.HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)** is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages.
